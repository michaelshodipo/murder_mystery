### Introduction
The SQL Murder Mystery is a detective-like task that required me to use my knowledge of writing SQL queries to figure out the murderer, using the three given clues and a database consisting of different tables to figure out the killer.
The clues: A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan.15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City . Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database.
